# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project, we are tasked with helping our friend Steve. He just graduated from college, and his parents are going to be his first clients for his new finance job. They are looking to specifically invest in green energy. Steve has gotten the data on a few green energy comapnies and wants us to simplify the data to display the performance of the companies' stocks in 2017 and in 2018. In addition to this, he would like us to refactor a VBA script so that it runs the analysis quicker than before.

*It looks very clear that performance in 2017 was much better than 2018. Only one stock in 2017 had negative returns for the year, while  10 stocks showed negative returns in 2018. Based on the performances of the stocks, I would advise Steve that DQ is actually not the best performer. It appears that the best performer over the 2 year span was ENPH. The ENPH increased 129.5% in 2017 and 81.9% in 2018.
